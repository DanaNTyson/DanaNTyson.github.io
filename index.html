				<h1>ISIS Enshrines a Theology of Rape</h1>
				<h3>Rukmini Callimachi</h3>
			<div class="description">
				<p> In conquered regions of Iraq and Syria, ISIS uses the Quran as a reason to rape females. With their reasoning, rape doesn't get seen as a sin; it brings them closer to God. The Islamic State fighters can attack these women without moral issue, especially the woman of the Yazidi religious minority. The article will explain what happened to the Yazidis women that were kidnapped by ISIS. They would use the women as sex slaves and that established a recruiting tool to entice men from deeply conservative Muslim societies. This article contains accounts from the survivors/refugees, but also has statistics and other notable information about these sickening incidents.</p>
