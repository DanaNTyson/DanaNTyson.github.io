				<p> A girl descibed a moment during her 11 months of captivty. Before a Islamic State fighter raped this 12-year-old girl, he took the time to explain that what he was about to do was not a sin. Because the preteen girl practiced a religion other than Islam, the Quran not only gave him the right to rape her &#8212; it condoned and encouraged it, he insisted.

						<p>&ldquo;He told me that according to Islam he is allowed to rape an unbeliever. He said that by raping me, he is drawing closer to God,&rdquo;</p>

				The Islamic State encorporates the systmatic rape of women and girls from the Yazidi religious minority in its organization and the radical theology. Interviews with 21 women and girls who recently escaped the Islamic State, as well as an examination of the group&rsquo;s official communications, illuminate how the practice has been enshrined in the group&rsquo;s core tenets.

				According to community leaders, a total of 5,270 Yazidis were abducted last year, and at least 3,144 are still being held. To handle them, the Islamic State has developed a detailed bureaucracy of sex slavery, including sales contracts notarized by the ISIS-run Islamic courts. And the practice has become an established recruiting tool to lure men from deeply conservative Muslim societies, where casual sex is taboo and dating is forbidden.</p>

				<h1>Calculated Conquest</h1>
				<p>The Islamic State began impenting the systematic sexual slavery on August 3, 2014 when its fighters invaded the villages in northern Iraq. Which happenede to be the home of the Yazidis, a tiny religious minority who represent less than 1.5 percent of Iraq&rsquo;s estimated population of 34 million.

				Survivors say that men and women were separated within the first hour of their capture. Adolescent boys were told to lift up their shirts, and if they had armpit hair, they were directed to join their older brothers and fathers. In village after village, the men and older boys were driven or marched to nearby fields, where they were forced to lie down in the dirt and sprayed with automatic fire.

				The women, girls and children, however, were hauled off in open-bed trucks. Then they separeted the young, unmarried girls into buses.
				
				In each location, survivors say Islamic State fighters first conducted a census of their female captives. Also, each captive was instructed to state her first, middle and last name, her age, her hometown, whether she was married, and if she had children.
				<aside class="pquote">
					<blockquote>
						<p>&ldquo;They laughed and jeered at us, saying &lsquo;You are our sabaya.&rsquo;&rdquo; which means slave.</p>
					</blockquote>
				</aside>
				&ldquo;He told us that Taus Malik&rdquo; &#8212; one of seven angels to whom the Yazidis pray &#8212; &ldquo;is not God. He said that Taus Malik is the devil and that because you worship the devil, you belong to us. We can sell you and use you as we see fit.&rdquo; <br/>

				The Islamic State&rsquo;s sex trade appears to be based solely on enslaving women and girls from the Yazidi minority. As yet, there has been no widespread campaign aimed at enslaving women from other religious minorities, said Samer Muscati, the author of the recent Human Rights Watch report. That assertion was echoed by community leaders, government officials and other human rights workers.<br/><br/>

				The Islamic State&rsquo;s interest with the Yazidis was likely because they are seen as polytheists, with an oral tradition rather than a written scripture. In the Islamic State&rsquo;s eyes that puts them on the fringe of despised unbelievers, even more than Christians and Jews.

				<h1>The Market</h1>
				<p>Based on the Islamic State&rsquo;s online magazine, enslaving the Yazidi women and girls was extensively preplanned. In one of the articles, it's clear that for the Yazidis, there was no chance to pay a tax known as jizya to be set free, &ldquo;unlike the Jews and Christians.&rdquo; <br/><br/>

				Similarity to American Slave Trade, the Islamic state used passages from their religious text to justify their human trafficking, experts say. In addition, many argue that slavery figures in Islamic scripture.<br/><br/>

				Mr. Bunzel, the author of a research paper published by the Brookings Institution on the ideology of the Islamic State said, &ldquo;There is a great deal of scripture that sanctions slavery, [but] you can argue that it is no longer relevant and has fallen into abeyance. ISIS would argue that these institutions need to be revived, because that is what the Prophet and his companions did.&rdquo;<br/><br/>

				The youngest, prettiest women and girls were bought in the first weeks after their capture. Others &#8212; especially older, married women &#8212; described how they were transported from location to location, spending months in the equivalent of human holding pens, until a prospective buyer bid on them.

				<h1>Property of ISIS</h1>
				<p>Of the 21 women and girls interviewed for this article, among the only ones who had not been raped were the women who were already pregnant at the moment of their capture, as well as those who were past menopause. <br/><br/>

				&ldquo;It is permissible to have intercourse with the female slave who hasn&rsquo;t reached puberty, if she is fit for intercourse,&rdquo;according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute of a pamphlet published on Twitter last December.<br/><br/>

				One 34-year-old Yazidi woman, who was bought and repeatedly raped by a Saudi fighter in the Syrian city of Shadadi, described how she fared better than the second slave in the household &#8212; a 12-year-old girl who was raped for days on end despite heavy bleeding.<br/><br/>

				Unmoved, the fighter ignored the girl&rsquo;s agony, continuing the ritual of praying before and after raping the child.</p>
